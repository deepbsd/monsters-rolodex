# Monsters Rolodex

Fun little app that fetches a list of users from typicode.com, grabs a random image from robohash.org, 
and creates a little rolodex type card with a "monster's" name and email.  

I've worked on larger react apps, but it's been a little while and this looked fun.

I got this from the Udemy course "Complete React Developer in 2019 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)".  So
far, I'm pretty impressed with the class.

You can see my instance of it at [monsters rolodex](https://deepbsd.github.io/monsters-rolodex).
