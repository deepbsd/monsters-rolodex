# Monsters Rolodex

Fun little app that fetches a list of users from typicode.com, grabs a random image from robohash.org, 
and creates a little rolodex type card with a "monster's" name and email.  

I've worked on larger react apps, but it's been a little while and this looked fun.

I got this from the Udemy course "Complete React Developer in 2019 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)".  So
far, I'm pretty impressed with the class.

My only regret at this point is that the gh-pages deploy didn't work.  For some reason, I can't seem to hit 
that page and have it render.  The app runs locally just fine though.  This might have something to do 
with the following:

1. I used npm instead of yarn as the instructor did.  (I had to translate the commands on the CLI and in package.json)
2. I already have a deployment at deepbsd.github.io that might interfere with deepbsd.github.io/monsters-rolodex

I don't know if either of these affects how gh-pages operates, but comparing my gh-pages branch with the instructor's,
I had almost none of the assets his gh-branch has, so I concluded that gh-pages module did NOT work for me.
Since the instructor only mentioned yarn and didn't mention npm, and since the problem appears to be a time sink
that will not produce a result worth the time spent on it, I'm not going to bother further with deploying using
gh-pages.

What you see is what I got.
